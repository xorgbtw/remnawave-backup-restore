- configurable backup retention policy for server-side and S3 backups separately

## Additional migration instructions:

<details>
  <summary>📝 Panel only: migrating to a new server</summary>
  
- edit the panel subdomain in Cloudflare to point to the new IP address. Also update subdomains of other services if they will be hosted on the new server
- perform directory and database restore
- restore domain certificates on your own (if required)
- the access link and password will be from the old panel that was previously backed up
- delete the old rule for the service port (default 2222) on all nodes and create a new one. This is necessary for the panel with the new IP address to communicate with them. Run the command on each node, replacing `OLD_IP` and `NEW_IP` with your own:

```bash
ufw delete allow from OLD_IP to any port 2222 && ufw allow from NEW_IP to any port 2222
```

- you're all set! All that's left is to install and configure any other services you need (e.g. kuma, beszel, etc.)

<details>
  <summary>📝 Panel+node: migrating to a new server</summary>
  
- edit the panel and "root" node (co-located with the panel) subdomains in Cloudflare to point to the new IP address. Also update subdomains of other services if they will be hosted on the new server
- restore domain certificates on your own (if required)
- perform directory and database restore
- enable panel access via port 8443 (eGames script, "Panel access management" option)
- the access link and password will be from the old panel that was previously backed up
- in node management, find the root node co-located with the panel. It contains the old server address. Change it to the new one — the node will activate automatically
- now close panel access via port 8443 the same way you opened it
- delete the old rule for the service port (default 2222) on all external nodes and create a new one. This is necessary for the panel with the new IP address to communicate with them. Run the command on each node, replacing `OLD_IP` and `NEW_IP` with your own:

```bash
ufw delete allow from OLD_IP to any port 2222 && ufw allow from NEW_IP to any port 2222
```

- you're all set! All that's left is to install and configure any other services you need (e.g. kuma, beszel, etc.)

<details>
  <summary>📝 Panel+node: switching to "Panel only" on the current server</summary>
  
- perform directory and database restore
- the access link and password will be from the old panel that was previously backed up
- delete the old "root" node from the panel along with its associated inbound and host
- delete the `.env-node` file from the panel server:
  
```bash
rm /opt/remnawave/.env-node
```

- you're all set! All that's left is to install and configure any other services you need (e.g. kuma, beszel, etc.)
